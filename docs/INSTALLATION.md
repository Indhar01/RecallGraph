## Development Installation

For contributors and developers:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Indhar01/MemoGraph.git
   cd MemoGraph
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install in editable mode with dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:

## Verify Installation

Check that everything is installed correctly:

print(memograph.__version__)
```

## Troubleshooting

### ImportError: No module named 'memograph'

Make sure you've installed the package:
```bash
pip install memograph
```

### Command 'memograph' not found

The CLI might not be in your PATH. Try:
```bash
python -m memograph --version
```

### Permission Errors

```

Or use a virtual environment (recommended).

### Dependency Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts, try creating a fresh virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv fresh_env
source fresh_env/bin/activate  # Windows: fresh_env\Scripts\activate
pip install memograph[all]
```
