See **[MCP_REGISTRY_GUIDE.md](docs/MCP_REGISTRY_GUIDE.md)** for complete submission and configuration guide.

### Usage Examples

Once configured, use natural language with your AI assistant:

```
"Search my vault for memories about Python"
"Create a memory titled 'Project Ideas' with content '...'"
"Update memory abc-123 to have salience 0.9"
"Delete memory xyz-456"
"What tools are available?"
"Get vault statistics"
```

See **[CONFIG_REFERENCE.md](memograph/mcp/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md)** for complete MCP configuration guide.

### Using Auto-Save Hooks

MemoGraph provides autonomous hooks to save conversations automatically:

- ⚠️ **Important**: Hooks are passive tools - see [Autonomous Hooks Guide](docs/AUTONOMOUS_HOOKS_GUIDE.md) for setup
- 📝 Quick fix: Add custom instructions to Claude Desktop (instructions in guide)
- 🔧 Configure with `MEMOGRAPH_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=true`

```bash
memograph --vault ~/my-vault ingest
```

Force re-indexing all files:

```bash
memograph --vault ~/my-vault ingest --force
```

### Remember

Quickly add a memory from the command line:

```bash
memograph --vault ~/my-vault remember \
    --title "Team Sync" \
    --content "Discussed Q3 goals." \
    --tags planning q3
```

### Context Window

```bash
memograph --vault ~/my-vault ask --chat --provider ollama --model llama3
```

Or ask a single question:

```bash
memograph --vault ~/my-vault ask \
    --query "Summarize our design decisions" \
    --provider claude \
    --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620

## 📖 Core Concepts

### Memory Types

MemoGraph supports different types of memories inspired by cognitive science:

- **Episodic**: Personal experiences and events (e.g., meeting notes)
- **Semantic**: Facts and general knowledge (e.g., documentation)
- **Procedural**: How-to knowledge and processes (e.g., tutorials)
- **Fact**: Discrete factual information (e.g., configuration values)

### Graph Traversal

The library uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to traverse your knowledge graph:

```python
# Retrieve nodes with depth=2 (2 hops from seed nodes)
nodes = kernel.retrieve_nodes(
    query="graph algorithms",
    depth=2,  # Traverse up to 2 levels deep
    top_k=10  # Return top 10 relevant memories
)
```

### Salience Scoring

Each memory has a salience score (0.0-1.0) that represents its importance:

```yaml
---
title: "Critical Architecture Decision"
salience: 0.9
memory_type: semantic
---

We decided to use PostgreSQL for better ACID guarantees...
```
